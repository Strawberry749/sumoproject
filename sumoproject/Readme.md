Traffic Simulation - First Milestone
GUI in JavaFX that renders a SUMO Simulation using the TraaS API to connect to SUMO and allows user control

Currently it is possible to start the GUI, when the GUI starts, the TraaS API connects to SUMO. If the button "start simulation" is pressed a SUMO simulation will start and informations about the traffic light will be printed.
